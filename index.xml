It&amp;rsquo;s up to players to come up with actions, and up to the disaster master to specify their difficulty and narrate successful or failed outcomes. Nudging players into taking the right actions might be a more subtle way for a DM to influence a session.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scenario</title><link>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/host/scenario/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2020 21:36:12 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/host/scenario/</guid><description>&lt;p>Incident scenario is the heart of every Deployments and Disasters session. In it disaster master defines the software system that gets hit by an incident as well as roles that players fulfill.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Actions</title><link>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/play/actions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2020 23:09:23 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/play/actions/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are 2 types of actions in a game of Deployments and Disasters:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Passive actions&lt;/strong> in which players collect information from the software system without changing it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Active actions&lt;/strong> in which players make changes to the system or interact with it in an active capacity.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Turn</title><link>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/play/turn/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2020 23:29:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/play/turn/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/play/session/#incident-stage">incident stage&lt;/a> of the Deployments and Disasters session is made up of individual turns. Each turn represents a 5 minutes increment on the incident clock. A turn begins with disaster master revealing any new information that become available. Players then discuss their options and agree on actions they intend to take. After that the dice are rolled to determine if actions succeed. A turn ends with DM narrating consequences of taken actions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Session</title><link>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/play/session/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2020 23:28:57 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/play/session/</guid><description>&lt;p>Each session of Deployments and Disasters is about resolving a single incident. A game session has 3 stages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Briefing stage&lt;/strong>, where DM explains the scenario they&amp;rsquo;ve prepared and players pick their roles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Incident stage&lt;/strong>, where DM introduces the incident and players take actions to resolve it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Review stage&lt;/strong>, where players discuss future proofing the system.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Roles</title><link>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/play/roles/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 23:50:18 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/play/roles/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a session of Deployments and Disasters there are 2 kinds of participants:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Disaster master&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Players&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Improve</title><link>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/design/improve/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 21:29:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/design/improve/</guid><description>Motivation In order to facilitate the other two key goals of scaling and cooperation the Deployments and Disasters rules gamify the actual process of resolving the incident. This means that players don&amp;rsquo;t experience using the tools and performing the management actions directly. Rather they explain their actions and intent, throw dice and disaster master determines the outcome.
Despite not featuring concrete tools directly, this format is a good way to promote certain tools.</description></item><item><title>Cooperate</title><link>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/design/cooperate/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 21:29:36 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/design/cooperate/</guid><description>Motivation Incident management process involves people from various roles. Those may include developers, ops engineers, support personnel, dedicated site reliability engineers, database administrators, etc. In order for the incident to be resolved efficiently they may all need to work together.
In addition to coming from different backgrounds and being used to working in different conditions those roles also have different goals. For example support staff may be trying to send some kind of notice to clients that are suffering degraded performance.</description></item><item><title>Scale</title><link>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/design/scale/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 21:23:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/design/scale/</guid><description>Motivation Deployments and Disasters is a tool for educating medium to large engineering teams about incident management techniques and procedures. Its usefulness grows with the size of the team. For example, in a 5 person team a new procedure will be communicated easily and all team members will be on board with it quickly. Contrast that with a 100+ people engineering division. At that scale communicating the existence, let alone the details of, a new procedure becomes challenging.</description></item><item><title>Goals</title><link>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/design/goals/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 21:03:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/design/goals/</guid><description>Key goals There are 3 key design goals that influence all decisions in Deployments and Disasters design. Those are:
Game should be scalable. Game should teach players to cooperate. Game should inspire players to improve. There are individual sections dedicated to each of the goals. There you can find a more detailed explanation of each goal and motivation behind it.
Impact of goals Some sections of rules, provided scenarios or other pieces of content on this site will call back to a design goal they reinforce.</description></item></channel></rss>
