The roles define:</p><ol><li>Information about the system that the player receives at the start of the game.</li><li>Proficiencies with specific tools that they have.</li></ol><div class="card rpg"><header><h4>RPG concept</h4></header><p>The role roughly corresponds to a classes in tabletop RPGs.</p></div><p>Some examples of roles include:</p><ul><li>Backend developer</li><li>DEVOPS engineer</li><li>Support operative</li><li>Site reliability engineer</li><li>Frontend developer</li><li>Database administrator</li><li>Business analyst</li></ul><div class="card notice"><header><h4>Notice</h4></header><p>Role you get assigned in a particular session of Deployments and disasters will likely differ from your actual job.
