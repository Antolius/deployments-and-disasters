Each turn represents a 5 minutes increment on the incident clock. A turn begins with disaster master revealing any new information that become available. Players then discuss their options and agree on actions they indent to take. After that the dice are rolled to determine if actions succeed. A turn ends with DM narrating consequences of taken actions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Session</title><link>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/play/session/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2020 23:28:57 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://antolius.github.io/deployments-and-disasters/play/session/</guid><description>&lt;p>Each session of Deployments and disasters is about resolving a single incident.
