## What you know

These are things that you know. They aren't secret, although you probably are the only one with this insight. You need to pay attention and share information with the team if and when it becomes relevant to the ongoing incident.

While URL shortening is free for all Short.ly's clients, they need to pay for click rate statistics. Not all clients opt for the payed plan though. At first click rates were only collected for the paying ones. However, it was sometimes hard for non-paying clients to see full value in buying those statistics. In order to improve the upsell we started tracking clock rates for all customers, and merely limit access to those statistics behind the pay wall. Now that we can directly show clients the value of statistics we collect for them they are more likely to transition into the paying tier.

You recently did a pilot project with client _Spam Ltd._ (client id **32**) who was looking for a way to track conversion rate of their email marketing campaign. In order to track conversion on individual recipient level they created personalized URLs, and shortened them using Short.ly. Then they sent a unique short URL to each recipient. This way they could check the click rate statistic to see if the recipient opened their unique URL, thus progressing in their user journey. This went really well and _Spam Ltd._ was happy with results. You are looking for more opportunities for this approach but so far none have appeared.

While Short.ly charges for access to click rates, what matters most to our clients is day to day performance of the redirecting service. Fast and reliable redirects are the first thing that clients care about. Without that base none of them would stick around for click rates. URL shortening SaaS market is a competitive one with plenty of alternatives for our clients to switch to.
