You are a site reliability engineer (SRE) at Short.ly. You work with the dev team to define key metrics to track and performance thresholds that services need to meet. You are in charge of setting up alerting on top of those metrics. It's your job to make sure that all the components of Short.ly's architecture are scaled correctly.

## What you know

{{< notice >}}
These are things that you know. They aren't secret, although you probably are the only one with this insight. You need to pay attention and share information with the team if and when it becomes relevant to the ongoing incident.

You try to track metrics from a perspective as close to clients are possible. In Short.ly's micro service architecture the `üì£Ô∏è Load Balancer` is the first component that clients' requests reach. Because of that you are focused mostly on metrics and logs collected from it.

### SLIs

Service level indicators are the key metrics that track the health of the system. In Short.ly those are:

1. Average latency of redirect responses (i.e. how long it takes Short.ly servers to respond to HTTP requests to short URLs).
1. 99th percentile latency of redirect responses.
1. Ratio of successful redirect responses (those with HTTP status codes `304` or `404`) out of total request rate on the short URLs.
1. Ratio of successful redirect responses (those with HTTP status codes `200` or `401`) out of total request rate on the URL shortening API used by clients.

The latency is only important for the redirects. Clients tolerate higher latency on the API they use to generate short URLs.

### SLOs

Service level objectives are performance targets that Short.ly system need to meet. In particular:

| SLI (the metric)                     | SLO (the target value) |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| avg. redirect latency                | < 10 ms                |
| 99th percentile redirect latency     | < 100 ms               |
| error ratio of redirect responses    | < 0.1% per hour        |
| error ratio of shorten API responses | < 1% per hour          |

### Scalability

Components of the Short.ly system are scaled according to expected load. For example, here are the queries per second (QPS) for HTTP requests:

|         | shortening API | redirects    |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Average | 200 req/s      | 20 000 req/s |
| Peak    | 400 req/s      | 50 000 req/s |

You've seen actual request rates approach these peak rates, and system performed within SLOs.

## What you are good at

In the game you can perform any actions you want, but these are the ones you are good at. When performing these action you add `+2` to your dice rolls.

* Querying metrics and logs from `üì£Ô∏è Load Balancer`. This includes latency, errors / success / total request rates.
* Checking capacity related metrics, such as free / used up disc space on database servers, memory usage of `üîóÔ∏è Cache` and `üì¨Ô∏è Events Queue`, number of redirect events in the queue.
* Setting up new application VMs to scale existing services.
