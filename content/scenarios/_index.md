After reading through instructions for Disaster Masters in the [how to host section]({{< ref "/host" >}}) you can take a look at the scenarios presented here. They should be detailed enough for you to run them without much prep, and generic enough for any group of players.

Do not read these scenarios if you have any plans or hopes of playing through them. They include materials written for Disaster Masters that would spoil the game for players.
