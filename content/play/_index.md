Deployments and disasters are designed to be as approachable as possible.

In this section you'll find game rules themselves, as well as some situational examples that illustrate them. Reading all of these materials is not a prerequisite for attending a session, as disaster master will go over the basic mechanics at the event. However, all curious players are encouraged to read on. That goes for first time disaster masters who are prepping for hosting their first game as well.
