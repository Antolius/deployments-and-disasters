## Motivation

In order to facilitate the other two key goals of [scaling]({{< ref "/design/scale.md" >}}) and [cooperation]({{< ref "/design/cooperate.md" >}}) the deployments and disasters rules gamefy actual process of resolving the incident. This means that players don't experience using the tools and performing the management actions directly. Rather they explain their actions and intent, throw dice and disaster master determines the outcome.

Despite not featuring concrete tools directly, this format is a good way to promote certain tools. Gamefication elements help out with making a given tool attractive to players. Additionally, a mix of players in a given session means there will likely have different real world skills. This can lead to sharing of knowledge between players themselves, with little involvement from the game.

This goal centers around highlighting tools and having players recognize their value. The expected outcome is players' investment in learning new tools and incorporating them in their incident management procedures.

## Measure

Direct way of gaining feedback on new tools is to include a dedicated question in the after-session poll. It can be as simple as:
* _What new tool did you learn about during the session?_
* _Have you discovered a new use-case for a tool you already use?_

More long-term you can work with players' managers (or mentors) and include mastering certain tools into their individual development plans.
