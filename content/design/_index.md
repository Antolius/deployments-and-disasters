This section goes in-depth with reasoning behind the Deployments and Disasters'  rules. It's intended for disaster masters, so if you are interesting in hosting a session yourself feel free to explore this.

Additionally, reading on the game's design can help you understand ways in which the game can help your company. Because of that this section can be interesting to you if you are considering introducing something like this to your organization.
