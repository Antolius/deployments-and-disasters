# Deployments & Disasters

A [tabletop RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game) for practicing [incident management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_management). 

## Getting started

If you are interested in getting to know the game rules along with the reasoning behind them you can check out the [design.md](./design.md) document. That is a good starting point for:

* Potential DMs interested in running a game / exercise like this.
* Anyone looking to contribute to the game.

In the future I'll be adding more resources more geared towards the players.

### Prerequisites

Deployments & Disasters is intentionally light on rules and mechanics. One of the goals of the game is to be accessible to players that are not familiar with other RPG systems. Another benefit of this is that DM also doesn't need a deep knowledge of other systems, although some experience is welcome. DM will need a deep understanding of the software system that game is centers around. Note that the system can be entirely fictional, or based on the real world example.

Other that rules you'll need:

> 5 six-sided dice. 

### Setting up a game

In order to host a session of Deployments & Disasters you'll need to familiarize yourself with the game rules and to devise an incident scenario. Currently there are no pre-build scenarios, but I am planning to include a few of them here.

### Running a game

Standard DM tips apply, with extra caution since players are more likely to be novices without previous experience. One particularity of the current system is that it lends itself well to one-off sessions, and not so much to prolonged campaigns. This, however, matches the design objective of serving as an educational tool for your engineering team(s).
