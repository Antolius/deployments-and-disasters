Those are:</p><ol><li>Game should be <a href=https://beploymentsanddisasters.com/design/scale/>scalable</a>.</li><li>Game should teach players to <a href=https://beploymentsanddisasters.com/design/cooperate/>cooperate</a>.</li><li>Game should inspire players to <a href=https://beploymentsanddisasters.com/design/improve/>improve</a>.</li></ol><p>There are individual sections dedicated to each of the goals. There you can find more detail explanation of each goal and motivation behind it.</p><h2 id=impact-of-goals>Impact of goals</h2><p>Some sections of rules, provided scenarios or other peaces of content on this site will call back to a design goal they reinforce. Event without an explicit callback try keeping these goals in mind and interpret every peace of content presented here through them. Some questions you can ask yourself are:</p><ol><li>Which goal is a given rule reinforcing?</li><li>How would inverting a given rule impact the goals?</li><li>Could changing a given rule move focus from one goal to another?</li></ol><h2 id=metrics>Metrics</h2><p>In addition to considering impact on individual rules you should also track how well each goal is met in a given game. For this you&rsquo;ll need a set of metrics and means of measuring them. This is why each goal comes with few suggestions for measuring its effectiveness.</p><p>Note that while playing Deployments and disasters is potentially fun it is primarily intended to be a learning exercise. As such you should always be looking at value that exercise provided to players who attended a session and the company you work for.</p></article></section><aside class="fifth-600 none"><h3>On this page</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#key-goals>Key goals</a></li><li><a href=#impact-of-goals>Impact of goals</a></li><li><a href=#metrics>Metrics</a></li></ul></nav></aside></div></main><footer><div></div></footer><script src=https://beploymentsanddisasters.com/js/mermaid.min.js></script><script src=https://beploymentsanddisasters.com/js/app.min.js></script></body></html>
