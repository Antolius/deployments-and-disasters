This means that players don&rsquo;t experience using the tools and performing the management actions directly. Rather they explain their actions and intent, throw dice and disaster master determines the outcome.</p><p>Despite not featuring concrete tools directly, this format is a good way to promote certain tools. Gamification elements help out with making a given tool attractive to players. Additionally, having a mix of diverse players in a session means they will likely have different real world skills. This can lead to sharing of knowledge between players themselves, with little involvement from the game.</p><p>This goal centers around highlighting tools and having players recognize their value. The expected outcome is players' investment in learning new tools and incorporating them in their incident management procedures.</p><h2 id=measure>Measure</h2><p>Direct way of gaining feedback on new tools is to include a dedicated question in the after-session poll. It can be as simple as:</p><ul><li><em>What new tool did you learn about during the session?</em></li><li><em>Have you discovered a new use-case for a tool you already use?</em></li></ul><p>More long-term you can work with players' managers or mentors to include mastering certain tools into their individual development plans.</p></article></section><aside class="fifth-600 none"><h3>On this page</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#motivation>Motivation</a></li><li><a href=#measure>Measure</a></li></ul></nav></aside></div></main><footer><div></div></footer><script src=https://beploymentsanddisasters.com/js/mermaid.min.js></script><script src=https://beploymentsanddisasters.com/js/app.min.js></script></body></html>
